# python-Text-To-Speech-tool
This Python code uses the pyttsx3 library to convert text into speech. It initializes the speech engine, speaks the phrase "welcome honey paaji", and then runs the engine to play the audio. It demonstrates a simple implementation of text-to-speech functionality in Python.
